# GradedRingUtilities
Utitilies for managing graded rings with Oscar.jl. Currently only supports the standard grading on the polynomial ring in n variables.

This is intended to be a temporary repository, the authors hope to merge this code into Oscar.jl in the "experimental" folder. The current code might not be ready for this, so for now it's here.
